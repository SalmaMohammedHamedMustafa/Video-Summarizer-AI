# Video Summarizer AI

This project implements an agentic AI system to extract, transcribe, OCR, and summarize video content. It uses modern generative AI models combined with multi-agent orchestration to produce both concise summaries and detailed documentation from multiple input modalities.

## Features

- **Audio Extraction**
   Extract audio tracks from video files using MoviePy (`video_utils.py`).
- **Audio Transcription**
   Transcribe extracted audio using OpenAI Whisper with support for chunked transcription of long files (`audio_processor.py`).
- **Frame Extraction & OCR**
   Extract video frames at regular intervals and perform OCR with Tesseract OCR to capture visible text in the video frames (`video_text_processor.py`).
- **Duplicate OCR Text Removal**
   Automatically remove repeated OCR-extracted texts to reduce redundancy (`video_text_processor.py`).
- **Agentic Summarization with LangGraph & Google Gemini**
   A multi-agent AI workflow that processes and merges information from OCR and transcription sources intelligently (`summary_creator.py`):
  - **OCR Agent**: Handles incomplete or noisy OCR text extraction with uncertainty awareness.
  - **Transcription Agent**: Produces detailed, accurate documentation from audio transcription.
  - **Fusion Agent**: Combines outputs from OCR and transcription agents to produce:
    - A concise summary.
    - A comprehensive full documentation.
- **Vector Store Construction for Semantic Search**
   Builds and saves a FAISS vector store from OCR and transcription texts to enable efficient similarity search and question answering (`vector_store_builder.py`).
- **Interactive Question Answering**
   Enables users to query the content of videos by searching the vector store and answering questions via Google Gemini generative AI (`question_answerer.py`).
- **Chunked Audio Transcription**
   For long audio files, transcription is processed chunk-by-chunk to handle resource constraints and improve performance (`audio_processor.py`).
- **Configurable File and Directory Management**
   Automatically manages directories and file paths for audios, transcriptions, OCR texts, summaries, full docs, and vector stores.
- **Warning and Log Suppression**
   Suppresses unnecessary warnings and logs for cleaner console output.

## Modules Overview

- **`audio_processor.py`**
   Handles loading audio files, chunked transcription with Whisper, and ensuring correct sampling rates.
- **`video_utils.py`**
   Utilities for extracting audio tracks from video files using MoviePy.
- **`video_text_processor.py`**
   Captures frames from video at configurable intervals, applies OCR, and removes duplicate extracted texts.
- **`summary_creator.py`**
   Implements a LangGraph-based multi-agent AI workflow using Google Gemini LLM for summarization and documentation fusion.
- **`vector_store_builder.py`**
   Builds FAISS vector indices from text files using HuggingFace embeddings, facilitating semantic search.
- **`question_answerer.py`**
   Provides a question-answering interface over the built vector store leveraging Google Gemini generative AI.
- **`main.py`**
   Orchestrates the full pipeline â€” from audio extraction, transcription, frame extraction, OCR, summarization, vector store creation, to interactive Q&A.

## System Architecture

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Extract audio track from the video file.
   - Perform transcription on the extracted audio (supports chunking).
   - Extract frames from the video at intervals and perform OCR.
   - Remove duplicate OCR texts.
2. **Agentic AI Graph**
   - OCR agent extracts reliable insights from possibly noisy OCR text.
   - Transcription agent produces accurate and detailed documentation.
   - Fusion agent intelligently combines OCR summary and transcription documentation into:
     - Concise summary file.
     - Detailed full documentation file.
3. **Vector Store & Q&A**
   - Build a FAISS vector store from OCR and transcription texts.
   - Enable semantic similarity searches and user question answering.

## Setup and Installation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) installed on your system (not a Python package).

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```
bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

## Install Python Dependencies

```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Set your Google Gemini API key as an environment variable:

```
bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

## Usage

1. Place your video file in a known directory.
2. Run the pipeline by executing:

```
bash
python main.py
```

1. Enter the video file path when prompted.

The system will:

- Extract audio and save as MP3.
- Transcribe audio (supports chunking).
- Extract frames at intervals and perform OCR.
- Remove duplicated OCR texts.
- Run the multi-agent summarization workflow.
- Save summary and full documentation to `results/`.
- Build vector store index for semantic search.
- Optional interactive Q&A on video content.

## Output Files

- Audio: `audios/{video_name}.mp3`
- Transcription: `transcriptions/{video_name}_transcription.txt`
- OCR Texts: `video_texts/{video_name}_texts.txt`
- Summary: `results/{video_name}_summary.txt`
- Full Documentation: `results/{video_name}_full_doc.txt`
- Vector Store: `vector_stores/{video_name}_vector_store/`
